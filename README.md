## Inspiration
Our inspirations were the educational accessibility and city tracks. We combined the two to specifically focus on making our cities more accessible. In our latest trip to NYC, we had a difficult time finding a restroom in the busy streets of Manhattan. It was only then that we realized how difficult it was to find an accessible restroom when you might understand the ins and outs of the city buildings. We wanted to make finding an accessible restroom safer and more accessible to the average tourist or city resident.  
## What it does
Our app provides the user with nearby bathrooms and lets them filter the nearby bathrooms by ADA compliance and gender-inclusivity. We provide our users a map with a pinpoint of the bathroom's location, the building's name, directions to the bathroom, and how far away they are in miles.

## How we built it
We built it with React and Vite. Our restrooms are held on our websites using React Components that get information from Refugee Restroom API. To decorate the website, we used Bootstrap and CSS. To further decorate the restroom components, we used Google Map API to show the location of the restrooms nearby. Lastly, we used Auth0 to make it so users can submit new accessible toilets to support the community. 
## Challenges we ran into
We ran into many challenges integrating the Google Maps API and providing our users with an individual map and pinpoint for each bathroom. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the amount of information we provide to our users, our interactive front end, and our compatibility with Google Maps which allows our users to seamlessly find the nearest bathroom that fits their needs
## What we learned
We learned a lot about front-end development, API integration, and team collaboration in a programming environment 
## What's next for CitySquats
The next step for CitySquats would be to allow users to share their thoughts on the bathroom quality and cleanliness in order to fit a person's standards, we could also add more filters to the bathrooms to cater to more of our user's personal needs - for example, diaper changing stations.
